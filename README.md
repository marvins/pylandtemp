## Description

**pylandtemp** is a Python library that provides a simple API for computing **global land surface temperature and emissivity** from NASA's [Landsat](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions) Level 1 satellite images (starting from Landsat 5 to Landsat 8).  It contains some implementations of Single-Channel and split window techniques. More methodologies under these groups will be added in the future.

Additionally, it also provides multiple methods for computing land surface emissivity. It is targeted towards supporting research and science workflows in many fields including climate science, earth sciences, remote sensing, space tech, geospatial data science, environmental studies, among others.


## Installation

The pylandtemp Python package is available through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pylandtemp/):

```
pip install pylandtemp
```


## Documentation

The pylandtemp Python library is divided into multiple methods which provide access to set of algorithms for different computations.


- **Land surface temperature**

    - Single-Channel: through the `single_window()` method
    - Split window: through the `split_window()` method

- **Land surface emissivity**
    - Through the `emmissivity()` method.

- **Brightness temperature**
    - Through the `brightness_temperature()` method.

- **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)**
    - Through the `ndvi()` method.


## Example

To compute land surface temperature using [Jiminez-Munoz et al. (2014)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6784508/?casa_token=A6cR6LeSSuoAAAAA:eFg3nxZvDTJpEBhvAmOwwJxo9rWy-y3aTdnArzEfbtM1UWUbBLhG9NhmeiQstFLTY8jbsT7x) split window technique and [Ugur Avdan et al. (2014)](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2016/1480307/) emissivity computation method, a simple implementation  is shown below:

```python
import numpy as np
from pylandtemp import split_window

# lst_method and emissivity_method should point to keys of chosen -
# algorithms for temeprature and emmisivity, respectively

# Keys for available algorithms are presented in the next section

# tempImage10 is a numpy array of band 10 brightness temperature 
# tempImage11 is a numpy array of band 10 brightness temperature 
# redImage is a numpy array of the red band
# nirImage is a numpy array of the near infra-red (NIR) band

lst_image_split_window = split_window(
    tempImage10, 
    tempImage11, 
    redImage, 
    nirImage, 
    lst_method='jiminez-munoz', 
    emissivity_method='avdan',
    unit='celcius'
)

# The function returns a numpy array which is the land surface temperature image.
```
